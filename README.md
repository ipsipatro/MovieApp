I have never used UIViewController Transitioning API and Async Display Kit before, so with given timeframe I dint feel it's a good idea to use it for the first time without having much information. With given more time, I would have tried follwing things to put in place

1: Use UIViewController Transitioning API for animation
2: Put MVVM design properly in place
3: could have used Async Display Kit
